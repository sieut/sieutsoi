Hi, my name is Sieu. I'm a software engineer based in Vietnam. I do random side projects outside of work to learn about random things. Besides software engineering, I also have a variety of hobbies that I cycle to keep me from being bored. Lately, I've been practicing quite a bit of motorsports, from sim racing, go karting, to risking my life on a motorcycle at the track.

I don't know what else to say so I'll end here.
