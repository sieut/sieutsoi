Hi, my name is Sieu. I'm a software engineer in the Bay Area. I do random side projects outside of work to learn about random things. Besides software engineering, I'm also practicing some musical skills. I'm very interested in vocals, and I know a thing or two about guitar and bass.

I don't know what else to say so I'll end here.
